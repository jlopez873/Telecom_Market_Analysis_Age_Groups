Getting Started with Telecom Market Analysis
============================================

This guide will help you set up the Telecom Market Analysis project on your local machine. Please follow the steps below to get started.

Prerequisites:
--------------
1. Python 3.x installed on your system (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. PostgreSQL installed on your system (https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

Step 1: Clone the Repository
-----------------------------
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/jlopez873/telecom-market-analysis-age-groups.git
cd telecom-market-analysis-age-groups

Step 2: Set up a Virtual Environment (Optional)
-----------------------------------------------
It's recommended to create a virtual environment to manage the project's dependencies:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use 'venv\Scripts\activate'

Step 3: Install Dependencies
----------------------------
Install the required Python packages using the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 4: Set up the PostgreSQL Database
--------------------------------------
Create a PostgreSQL database and import the provided SQL scripts to create and populate the tables:

1. Launch the PostgreSQL command-line interface (psql) or a GUI tool like pgAdmin.
2. Create a new database and connect to it.
3. Import the SQL scripts located in the 'sql' folder.

Step 5: Update Database Connection Information
----------------------------------------------
Update the database connection information (host, port, database name, user, and password) in the Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks as needed.

Step 6: Run the Jupyter Notebooks
----------------------------------
Start the Jupyter Notebook server by running the following command:

jupyter notebook

Navigate to the 'notebooks' folder and open the desired notebook. Run the cells to perform the analysis and view the results.

Step 7: Explore the Results
---------------------------
The 'results' folder contains the output files and results obtained from the analysis. You can explore these files to gain insights into the telecom market and customer preferences.

If you have any questions or need assistance, please consult the README.md file or contact the project author.
